## COVID-19 World Vaccination Analysis

This project provides a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` format) to analyze and visualize COVID-19 vaccination progress worldwide using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about daily and total vaccinations, as well as other related data.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Dataset

Before running the code, download the dataset from the following Kaggle link and save it as "country_vaccinations.csv" in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook:

[COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress)

### Running the Code

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `covid_vaccination_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

2. Run the code cells in the notebook one by one. You can do this by clicking on a cell and then pressing `Shift+Enter` or using the "Run" button in Jupyter Notebook.

3. The code will load the dataset, explore its structure, perform data analysis, and create visualizations.

### Code Structure

- The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

- It loads the dataset from the "country_vaccinations.csv" file. Please make sure to specify the correct file path if it's in a different location.

- It explores the dataset by displaying basic information about the dataset, the first few rows, summary statistics, and checking for missing values.

- It calculates and displays the top 10 countries with the highest total vaccinations.

- It creates visualizations, including a bar chart showing the top 10 countries by total vaccinations and a line chart displaying the daily vaccinations trend.

### Results

The code provides insights into COVID-19 vaccination progress, such as the top countries with the highest total vaccinations and the daily vaccinations trend. You can customize the analysis as needed.
